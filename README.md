# Reflection
## About
Reflection is a game made using Godot Engine v3.5. Currently Reflection is still in the making.

In the game you follow journey of a young man named Salim as he tries to grasp what he wants to do with his life and who he is.

Project began on October 2022 and I hope to finish it by Summer/Fall 2023.
# FAQs
## What I can and can't do with this project?

## How can I play the game?
Currently you can't as this project doesn't have demo version. As soon as I'll release it I'll link it here.
